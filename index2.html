      <h1> Hettie McConnell </h1>
      <p id="intro_para"> Hi,  welcome to my Founders and Coders application page, thank you for visiting! Since graduating in 2018 I have found work in a few different industries, but often found myself restless and bored with the repetition of mundane tasks. I have realised I would be much better suited to skill based work. I have become obsesesed with the ability to create something out of nothing, which coding has given me, and hope to further my learning through Founders and Coders</p>

I have seen firsthand the environmental and sociological issues we are encountering in countries all over the world. I have always known that I want to help ease this in some way. With the rise of startup companies, there is no limit to where I can begin my career and how many of these companies I can help. Learning to code will give me the flexibility to purse those opportunities that I am most passionate about.</p>

              <p class = "slide_info">At university I studied Economics BSc and gained a first class degree. My time there taught me that I thrived most  when left to my own devices. With a love of problem-solving, I often found myself more engaged when forced to look at a problem outside of the box and rely on my own research, rather than having things spoon-fed to me. I also believe that it is important to surround yourself with others who share the same goals as you. The peer-led learning at FAC supports my belief in the importance of group-work and sharing your ideas and creativity with others.</p>

            <p class = "slide_info">A naturally bright and curious individual, I am looking for a job where no two days are the same, where I am challenged every day and where I am constantly given the opportunity to learn new things. Coding is a life-time skill, but also a never-ending curve where there is always more to learn. I often find myself restless when given repetetive tasks and relish the possibility of being able to expand my knowledge infinitely. </p>
