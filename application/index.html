      <h1> Hettie McConnell </h1>
      <h2> Hello and welcome to my Founders and Coders application page, thank you for visiting! Since graduating in 2018 I have found work in a few different industries, but often found myseslf restless and bored with the repetition of mundane tasks. I have realised I would be much better suited to skill based work. I have become obsesesed with the ability of being able to create something out of nothing, which coding has given me, and hope to further my learning through Founders and Coders</h2>

        <!-- I have spent a lot of my time travelling and volunteering overseas.
        I have seen firsthand the environmental and sociological issues we are encountering in countries all over the world.
        I have always known that I want to help ease this in some way. With the rise of startup companies, there is no limit
        to where I can begin my career and how many of these companies I can help. Learning to code will give me the
        flexibility to purse those opportunities that I am most passionate about.  -->

        <!-- At university I studied Economics BSc and gained a first class result. My time there taught me that I thrived most
        when left to my own devices. With a love of problem-solving, I often found myself more engaged when forced to look at
        a problem outside of the box and rely on my own research, rather than having things spoon-fed to me. I also believe
        that it is important to surround yourself with others who share the same goals as you. The peer-led learning at FAC
        supports my belief in the importance of group-work and sharing your ideas and creativity with others.  -->

        <!-- A naturally bright and curious individual, I am looking for a job where no two days are the same, where I am
        challenged every day and where I am constantly given the opportunity to learn new things. Coding is a life-time
        skill, but also a never-ending curve where there is always more to learn. I often find myself restless when given
        repetetive tasks and relish the possibility of being able to expand my knowledge infinitely.  -->
